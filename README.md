# Torrent To Google Drive
The script facilitates downloading torrent files and magnet links directly to Google Drive using Google Colab. It starts by installing and configuring the libtorrent library for managing torrent sessions. After mounting Google Drive, users can upload torrent files or input magnet links to initiate downloads. The script saves the downloaded files to a designated folder in Google Drive. It includes a progress monitoring system using interactive widgets, which provide real-time updates on download status and completion. This approach streamlines file management by leveraging cloud storage and eliminates the need for local storage.
